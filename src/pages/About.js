                <h1>About Taradasi Medics</h1>
                <p>
                    Taradasi Medics is a family owned Zambian business.<br/><br/>

                    We take pride in helping African dentists achieve their goals.<br/><br/>

                    We have a strong service orientated working culture. Every member of our staff knows that their salary is paid by clients, not administration.<br/><br/>

                    This simple fact makes our service reliable, fast and friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are in business since 2011.<br/><br/>

                    Our company was previously known by a different name. Then we decided to change it and start anew.<br/><br/>

                    During these years we have been supplying more than 100 African Dentists and Medics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are Dentists like yourself.<br/><br/>

                    Our Managing Director is a Dentist Surgeon with 25 years of experience. Most of our managerial staff has Dental experience as well.<br/><br/>

                    This makes a world of difference. Because we learn what equipment works well and what doesn’t not from our clients’ words, but from our own experience.<br/><br/>

                    We take a delight in helping our clients after purchase as well.<br/><br/>

                    If you have any professional questions about any materials, equipment and instruments, please ask us.
